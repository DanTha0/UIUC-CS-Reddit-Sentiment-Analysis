# UIUC-CS-Reddit-Sentiment-Analysis

1. Run get.py (this can take long sometimes 20 minutes depending on the number of pages scraped, do this only once a while to generate pkl file)
2. Run sentiment.pycourses.json to get a -1 to 1 score of the sentiment on each course ranked

You can modify courses.json to test given courses (you can courses.json using UIUC's Course Explorer API)
